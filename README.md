### School App - with Facial Recognition

This application was a part of my Final Year's project.
Took me around 1.5 Months to complete this project.

Below are the core modules present within the application

## Facial Recognition (OpenCV)
- The ability to mark a student's attendance using Facial Recognition
- The attendance is marked for the day in an XL sheet.

## PDF to Images Converter
- This module converts PDFs to images so that the students can read books from the app itself
- It is done by taking each page of the pdf and adding it to a card in the carousel.
